# this was my first project ever
its a total mess
- started on replit
- then migrated to my server
- then hastily connected to my websites database
- then containerized
i have no idea how any of it works, and most of the code is awful because i never knew what i was doing, and i never bothered to clean it up

theres a folder with marge simpson voice clips because i didnt know what .gitignore was
